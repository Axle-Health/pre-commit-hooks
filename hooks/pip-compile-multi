# Q: Why do we not handle the requirements.in case alongside the *requirements.in case?
# A: Because then the comments inside the requirements.txt file say:
# 
#    #  This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with python 3.10
#    # To update, run:
#    #
#    #    pip-compile requirements.in
#    #
# 
# instead of:
# 
#    #  This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with python 3.10
#    # To update, run:
#    #
#    #    pip-compile
#    #
# 
# which is what is generated if someone just runs pip-compile by itself. This
# causes superfluous changes that we do not want.
